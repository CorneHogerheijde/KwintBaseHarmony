# KwintBaseHarmony - Development Plan

## Overview

**Goal**: Build a functional MVP that demonstrates the core "harmony learning through composition puzzles" concept, and progressively expand into a full Phase 3 feature set.

**Timeline**: Active development  
**Target Users**: Musicians and music educators

---

## Phase 5 — Authentication & Authorization

**Phase 5.1 Status** *(April 18, 2026)*: ✅ **Complete** — PR #38 merged

**Phase 5.2 Status** *(April 18, 2026)*: ✅ **Complete** — Auth enforcement on all endpoints

**Phase 5.2b Status** *(April 21, 2026)*: ✅ **Complete** — Social OAuth providers + user-linked compositions (PR #49)

**Phase 5.3 Status** *(April 21, 2026)*: ✅ **Complete** — Circle of Fifths puzzle expansion (PR #45)

**Phase 5.4 Status** *(April 21, 2026)*: ✅ **Complete** — Notation Preview Fix (grand staff, octave-aware labels, chords)

---

### Phase 5.4 Deliverables — Notation Preview Fix

Notation currently renders all notes without octave context, making it impossible to distinguish C3 from C4. Clef selection is also static — all notes appear in treble regardless of their register.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Octave-aware note labels | Display notes as `C4`, `G3`, `F♯5` etc. in both the puzzle hint and the notation canvas | ✅ |
| Grand staff rendering | Treble + bass staves always rendered; notes ≥ MIDI 60 go on treble, notes < 60 go on bass | ✅ |
| Simultaneous notes (chords) | Multiple notes on the same beat rendered as a chord on the appropriate staff | ✅ |
| Middle C ledger line | C4 (MIDI 60) shown with its ledger line between the two staves | ✅ |
| Scaled-down canvas | Canvas height increased to fit both staves; note/staff size reduced slightly to maintain layout | ✅ |
| `midiToOctaveLabel(midi)` helper | Centralised function used by piano, notation, and puzzle hints; `Math.floor(midi/12)-1` for octave | ✅ |
| Regression tests | Vitest unit tests for `midiToOctaveLabel`, staff assignment, chord grouping logic | ✅ |

**Future improvements (notation preview):**

| Improvement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Time signature display | Render a 4/4 (or configurable) time signature symbol at the start of both treble and bass staves. Currently omitted; notation preview is a visual aid rather than a strict score. |

---

### Phase 5.3 Deliverables — Circle of Fifths Puzzle Expansion

Current puzzles always use C major / A minor as the tonal centre. This milestone introduces key-aware puzzles that progress through the circle of fifths, exposing students to sharp keys (G, D, A, E, B, F♯), flat keys (F, B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭), and the associated accidentals.

**Theory foundation (Hoffman Academy / standard music theory):**
- Circle of fifths: C → G → D → A → E → B → F♯ (sharp keys, clockwise) / C → F → B♭ → E♭ → A♭ → D♭ → G♭ (flat keys, counter-clockwise)
- Each clockwise step adds one sharp (the 7th scale degree of the new key)
- Each counter-clockwise step adds one flat (the 4th scale degree of the new key)
- Identification trick: last sharp + half-step up = key name; next-to-last flat = key name

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `keyProfile` data model | Per-key definition: root MIDI (reuses existing `rootMidi` column), scale degrees, accidentals list | ⬜ |
| `rootMidi` extended to all 12 keys | No new DB column; `rootMidi` already stored — UI and layer data now use it as the key selector | ⬜ |
| Key picker replaces root picker | Home page key dropdown replaces the existing root selector (same data, richer UI) | ⬜ |
| Sharp-key puzzles (4 keys) | G, D, A, E major — layer targets transpose via `rootMidi` offset from C | ⬜ |
| Flat-key puzzles (4 keys) | F, B♭, E♭, A♭ major — same transposition logic; ♭ accidentals applied | ⬜ |
| Accidental notation rendering | ♯ and ♭ symbols rendered correctly before note heads on the grand staff | ⬜ |
| Key signature display | Sharps/flats drawn at start of both treble and bass staves | ⬜ |
| Educator progression mode | Ordered journey through keys: C → G → D → A (easier) then flat side | ⬜ |
| Theory panel per key | Collapsible panel explaining the key's sharps/flats and their circle-of-fifths position | ⬜ |
| Vitest unit tests | Tests for key transposition, accidental labelling, scale-degree lookup per key | ⬜ |
| Cypress E2E tests | Select G major → verify F♯ appears in notation; select B♭ → verify B♭ and E♭ appear | ⬜ |

---

### Phase 5.2b Deliverables — Social OAuth & User-Linked Compositions

| Conditional OAuth registration | Google / Microsoft / LinkedIn only registered at startup when `ClientId` **and** `ClientSecret` are non-empty | ✅ |
| `GET /api/auth/providers` | Returns array of configured provider slugs; anonymous endpoint used by frontend | ✅ |
| `GET /api/auth/oauth/{provider}` | Issues OAuth challenge; returns 400 if provider not registered | ✅ |
| `appsettings.json` auth sections | Empty `Auth:Google/Microsoft/LinkedIn` config slots added | ✅ |
| Dynamic OAuth buttons | `scripts/oauth-providers.js` fetches `/api/auth/providers` and renders only available buttons | ✅ |
| OAuth callback in `login.js` | Reads `?token=` / `?error=` from redirect URL and stores/displays result | ✅ |
| Auto-load user compositions | `home.js` auto-fetches compositions when user is logged in (no manual lookup needed) | ✅ |
| OAuth provider setup docs | `RUNNING_LOCALLY.md` — step-by-step guide for Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn registration | ✅ |
| Test social auth providers | End-to-end test with real credentials for Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn flows | ⬜ |

---

---

## Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Completed**: April 15, 2026  
**Tests**: 65 passing (31 backend + 34 Cypress E2E)  
**Result**: MVP validated with real musicians. Core puzzle concept works. Two UX gaps (piano fidelity, difficulty differentiation) and three feature gaps identified for Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 Backlog

Derived from WS3-3.2 musician testing (April 15, 2026). Prioritized by impact on the stated failure modes: *task clarity* and *UI discoverability*.

### ✅ Priority 1 — Difficulty Differentiation *(complete — PR #13, April 15 2026)*
**Problem**: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced selection had no effect on the puzzle experience. Testers noticed.  
**Solution**: `getPuzzleLayers(difficulty)` factory in `puzzle-engine.js`; `puzzle.js` reads `composition.difficulty` from the API response and threads it through all engine calls.
- **Beginner**: verbose prompts, hint always visible (no Show Answer button), C4-range targets
- **Intermediate**: concise prompts, hint on request only, unchanged target notes
- **Advanced**: minimal prompts, bass voicing starting at C3 (MIDI 48), open-position spread
- Cypress tests: 34 → 41 (7 new difficulty-specific tests)

### ✅ Priority 2 — 88-Key Piano with Zoom/Pan *(complete — PR #15, April 15 2026)*
**Problem**: Current 25-key keyboard (MIDI 48–72) doesn't resemble a real piano; musicians felt disoriented.  
**Solution**: Full 88-key keyboard (MIDI 21–108) with horizontal scroll viewport, zoom-in/zoom-out buttons, absolute positioning of keys, and auto-scroll to the target note on each layer advance.
- Layer 5 also renamed from "The Ninth" to "The Secunde" in all code and spec documents
- Cypress tests: 29 new puzzle-flow tests including 5 piano/zoom tests

### ✅ Priority 3 — Improved Piano Visual *(complete — resolved in Priority 2)*
**Problem**: Key proportions and labeling feel abstract.  
**Solution**: Authentic black/white key proportions via absolute positioning, note name labels on white keys, subtle border-radius on key bottoms. Resolved as part of Priority 2 piano rewrite.

### ✅ Priority 4 — Arpeggio Playback *(complete — PR #16, April 15 2026)*
**Problem**: "Play Everything So Far" plays all notes as a simultaneous chord — not how harmony is typically experienced.  
**Solution**: `playArpeggio(composition, bpm)` in `playback.js` plays one note per completed layer in order, spaced by one beat (90% staccato). BPM slider (40–160, default 72) added to the piano toolbar with live label.
- Cypress tests: 4 new arpeggio tempo tests

### ✅ Priority 5 — Circle of Fifths Reference *(complete — PR #17, April 15 2026)*
**Problem**: Testers lacked context for *why* the notes were chosen in this order.  
**Solution**: Inline SVG circle-of-fifths diagram at the bottom of the puzzle card. Root (C) shown with an accent ring; current layer's target note filled accent-colour; dashed line connects root to target. Updates on every layer advance.
- Cypress tests: 4 new circle-of-fifths tests
